**Pure Accordion Menu**

This is a simple implementation of an accordion menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu consists of a list of items, each of which can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide its content.

### Features

- Clicking on an accordion item's header expands or collapses the corresponding content section.
- Only one accordion item can be open at a time. Opening a new item automatically closes any previously opened item.
- The first accordion item is open by default on page load.
- The content of each accordion item can have a fixed height and will display scrollbars if the content exceeds the available space.

### Compatibility

This accordion menu is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
